  summary: 'Born and bred on the island of Malta, Jean has earned a degree with honors from the University of Middlesex. Before his work in iGaming, he worked for a company named i2b Studio right out of University, where digitalizing Maltese Education was the name of the game. While his work currently focuses mainly on Web Development, occasionally he opts for various kinds of projects were getting shit done is the formula that reigns. His non-work interests still hail under the tech umbrella. Everything from a chess desktop application that detects & analyses the chessboard using OpenCV & Stockfish to programatically ensuring that a grocery delivery slot is booked at the height of Covid19.'

    reference: 'Studying and working together (as my senior); I can put it quite clearly, Jean is hard-working, and loves a good competition.   He''s a good asset to any company, due to the fact that Jean has something that most don''t; He''s ambitious, and the best feature we had in common is that he yearns for knowledge; knowledge which can be seen in his work.  It''s a pleasure to have worked with Jean, and I''m looking forward to working with him again someday.'
